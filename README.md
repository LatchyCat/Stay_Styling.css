### Subtle Animations
- **Purposeful Motion**: Integrates animations that serve a functional purpose, such as guiding users' attention or indicating actions. These are carefully designed to be subtle yet effective, avoiding distractions.
- **Interactive Triggers**: Animations often activate upon user interactions, such as hover or click, adding a layer of engagement. Continuous animations might also be employed to draw attention to specific elements.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly applied to background elements, icons, and loading indicators, these animations enhance the user experience by providing visual cues and feedback.

### Interactive Feedback

- **Engagement Through Interaction**: Ensures that the website feels alive and responsive to user actions, increasing engagement and improving the overall experience.
- **Practical Implementation**: Particularly useful for form inputs, navigation menus, and social media icons, interactive feedback helps in creating a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
